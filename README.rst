.. _CLSCL:

CLSCL
~~~~~

An implementation of Cross-Language Structural Correspondence Learning (CLSCL). 
See [Prettenhofer2010]_ for a detailed description and 
[Prettenhofer2011]_ for more experiments and enhancements.

The data for cross-language sentiment classification that has been used in the above
study can be found here [#f2]_.

clscl_train
???????????

Training script for CLSCL. See `./clscl_train --help` for further details. 

Usage::

    $ ./clscl_train en de cls-acl10-processed/en/books/train.processed cls-acl10-processed/en/books/unlabeled.processed cls-acl10-processed/de/books/unlabeled.processed cls-acl10-processed/dict/en_de_dict.txt model.bz2 --phi 30 --max-unlabeled=50000 -k 100 -m 450 --strategy=parallel

.. _NER:

Named-Entity Recognition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple greedy left-to-right sequence labeling approach to named entity recognition (NER). 

pre-trained models
??????????????????

We provide pre-trained named entity recognizers for place, person, and organization names in English and German. To tag a sentence simply use::

    >>> from nut.io import compressed_load
    >>> from nut.util import WordTokenizer

    >>> tagger = compressed_load("model_demo_en.bz2")
    >>> tokenizer = WordTokenizer()
    >>> tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("Peter Prettenhofer lives in Austria .")

    >>> # see tagger.tag.__doc__ for input format
    >>> sent = [((token, "", ""), "") for token in tokens]
    >>> g = tagger.tag(sent)  # returns a generator over tags
    >>> print(" ".join(["/".join(tt) for tt in zip(tokens, g)]))
    Peter/B-PER Prettenhofer/I-PER lives/O in/O Austria/B-LOC ./O

You can also use the convenience demo script `ner_demo.py`::

    $ python ner_demo.py model_en_v1.bz2

The feature detector modules for the pre-trained models are `en_best_v1.py` and `de_best_v1.py` and can be found in the package `nut.ner.features`.
In addition to baseline features (word presence, shape, pre-/suffixes) they use distributional features (brown clusters), non-local features (extended prediction history), and gazetteers (see [Ratinov2009]_). The models have been trained on CoNLL03 [#f4]_. Both models use neither syntactic features (e.g. part-of-speech tags, chunks) nor word lemmas, thus, minimizing the required pre-processing. Both models provide state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL03 shared task benchmark for English [Ratinov2009]_::

    processed 46435 tokens with 4946 phrases; found: 4864 phrases; correct: 4455.
    accuracy:  98.01%; precision:  91.59%; recall:  90.07%; FB1:  90.83
                  LOC: precision:  91.69%; recall:  90.53%; FB1:  91.11  1648
                  ORG: precision:  87.36%; recall:  85.73%; FB1:  86.54  1630
                  PER: precision:  95.84%; recall:  94.06%; FB1:  94.94  1586

and German [Faruqui2010]_::

    processed 51943 tokens with 2845 phrases; found: 2438 phrases; correct: 2168.
    accuracy:  97.92%; precision:  88.93%; recall:  76.20%; FB1:  82.07
                  LOC: precision:  87.67%; recall:  79.83%; FB1:  83.57  957
                  ORG: precision:  82.62%; recall:  65.92%; FB1:  73.33  466
                  PER: precision:  93.00%; recall:  78.02%; FB1:  84.85  1015


To evaluate the German model on the out-domain data provided by [Faruqui2010]_ use the raw flag (`-r`) to write raw predictions (without B- and I- prefixes)::

    ./ner_predict -r model_de_v1.bz2 clner/de/europarl/test.conll - | clner/scripts/conlleval -r
    loading tagger... [done]
    use_eph:  True
    use_aso:  False
    processed input in 40.9214s sec.
    processed 110405 tokens with 2112 phrases; found: 2930 phrases; correct: 1676.
    accuracy:  98.50%; precision:  57.20%; recall:  79.36%; FB1:  66.48
                  LOC: precision:  91.47%; recall:  71.13%; FB1:  80.03  563
                  ORG: precision:  43.63%; recall:  83.52%; FB1:  57.32  1673
                  PER: precision:  62.10%; recall:  83.85%; FB1:  71.36  694


Note that the above results cannot be compared directly to the resuls of [Faruqui2010]_ since they use a slighly different setting (incl. MISC entity).

ner_train

Training script for NER. See ./ner_train --help for further details. 

To train a conditional markov model with a greedy left-to-right decoder, the feature 
templates of [Rationov2009]_ and extended prediction history 
(see [Ratinov2009]_) use::

    ./ner_train clner/en/conll03/train.iob2 model_rr09.bz2 -f rr09 -r 0.00001 -E 100 --shuffle --eph

ner_predict
???????????

You can use the prediction script to tag new sentences formatted in CoNLL format 
and write the output to a file or to stdout. 
You can pipe the output directly to `conlleval` to assess the model performance::

    ./ner_predict model_rr09.bz2 clner/en/conll03/test.iob2 - | clner/scripts/conlleval
    loading tagger... [done]
    use_eph:  True

                  LOC: precision:  87.29%; recall:  88.91%; FB1:  88.09  1699

  * If you copy a new version of `bolt` into the `externals` directory make sure to run cython on the `*.pyx` files. If you fail to do so you will get a `PickleError` in multiprocessing.
